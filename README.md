# IL2232-ADs-AI
This is AI part work from Automated Driving Project for IL2232 Embedded Systems Design Project HT23 at KTH. The source code is mainly about transforming image from dataset from vehicle camera to interaction graph and using GNN model to process graph in order to predict the realtion between the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles and thus determine whether it is hazard or not.
